🎯 How to Create the Template
1. Create the Template Sheet

Create a new Google Sheet
Go to Extensions → Apps Script
Delete existing code
Copy/paste the entire GhostMembersSync.gs file
Save (Ctrl/Cmd + S)
Refresh the sheet - you'll see "👻 Ghost Sync" menu appear

2. Set It Up Nice

Rename the sheet to something like "Ghost Members Sync Template"
Add instructions in the first tab (optional but helpful)
Maybe add example data showing what the columns look like

3. Publish as Template

File → Share → Publish to web (optional)
File → Make a copy to test it works
Share the link with "Anyone with the link can view"
Tell users to click "Use Template" when they open it
